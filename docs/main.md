# WAGO SCADA User Manual: Introduction to SCADA

## 1. What is SCADA?

A **Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)** system is an industrial control system used to **monitor** and **control** facility- and infrastructure-based processes. It is a critical component in **industrial automation**, enabling engineers to manage complex, distributed processes from a central location.

### 1.1 Core Functions

SCADA systems perform four primary functions:

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Collecting real-time information (status, measurements, events) from remote devices like **PLCs** and sensors.
2.  **Data Communication:** Securely transferring data back to the central master station.
3.  **Data Presentation (HMI):** Displaying the collected data and system status via a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) for operators.
4.  **Control:** Allowing operators to issue commands and make adjustments to remote equipment.

## 2. Key System Characteristics

Modern SCADA systems are designed for flexibility and scalability to meet the demands of Industry 4.0.

### 2.1 Web-Based and Cloud-Ready Architecture

Our modern SCADA platform is **web-based**, meaning the operator interface runs directly in a standard web browser without the need for specialized client software installation. This also makes the system **cloud-ready**, offering benefits like:

* **Scalability:** Easily expanding resources to accommodate a growing number of field devices.
* **Accessibility:** Securely monitoring and controlling assets from anywhere.
* **Maintenance:** Centralized updates and management, reducing on-site maintenance costs.

### 2.2 Visualization and Control

The Human-Machine Interface (HMI) is the main window into the system, presenting complex data in an easy-to-digest graphical format.

The image below illustrates a typical SCADA dashboard used for real-time monitoring and control:
